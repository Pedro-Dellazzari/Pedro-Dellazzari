#### About Me

I started my academic/professional life studying Public Relations. After getting my firts job in the communication departament I noticed that data can be the most powerful resource inside a company. Since then I felt completly passionate about data and the infite possibilites of analyses and insights, so I chance my area of graduation and started to learn and focus 100% of my time to Data Science. 
Now I'm looking for a oportunity to put me inside of the Data Science world and make me a true Data Scientis. So if you wanna talk, I'm here!
